### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs that we have done. The reason why I liked this assignment was because I got the chance to be like a cop and was able to tell when cars were able to park in that certain place and at a certain time. I also loved having to work with numbers and if they were parking there at the right time and day. I learned how to create a function that could tell if cars were able to part there.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part-2 was another one of my favorites because I was able to create my very own blackjack game, which is my favorite card game to play. I also loved playing blackjack when I was testing the code. I learned how to create a function that could calculate its correct value.

* Lab 4

    Finally Lab 4, part-2 was my last favorite assignment because I was able to create my very own little game. It felt really cool to be able to create a two player game that I can play with other people. When I finished that code I actually played that game with my dad to show him my work. I learned how to code a two player game, where one player had to pick a number and the other had to guess what the first player chose and if he gets it right, he wins and if he doesnâ€™t get it after two tries, player 1 wins.
